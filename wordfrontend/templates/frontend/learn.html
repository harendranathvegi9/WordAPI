<p>The wordAPI is a standalone, restful interface offering word and topic
analysis capabilities.  This includes but is not limited to the fearsomely
awesome TagCloud API.</p>

<p>In addition, check out Word API's "collections" service. A collection is a set
of natural language source documents that you register with word API. The
collection can be static or dynamic. Word API offers several
(language-oriented) tools to study these collections, including a dashboard for
ongoing statistics such as ngram frequency counts, entropy, unusual phrases,
topic analyzers, and classifiers for topic and similarity. Once you define a
collection, you can check up on it by visiting its dashboard, or access any of
the statistics or classifier capabilities via the API.</p>
