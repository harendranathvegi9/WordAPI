wordjs:
	unique ids need to be character strings not numbers. 
	randomize order of words
	colours
	max_words
	strip punctuation (?,-'"!()./;- etc.)
	user specified stop words
	return style, html separately (what if they don't want to use our stylesheet)?
	fill in whitespace
	make wordcloud an object not a function, let the user tweak stuff interactively. 
	distribution of word frequnecies - spark line ish
	remove jquery dependency? only really used as element selector
	ensure all css is properly scoped by wordcloud id (css selectors - space vs. comma!)

topicmonster
	click handler to add selected word as stop word
	river of news - d3.
